React Context is a way to manage state globally.

It can be used together with the useState Hook to share state between deeply nested components more easily than with useState alone.

Context API in React is used to share data across the components without passing the props manually through every level. It allows to create global state of data providing global access to all the components.

Context API is used to pass global variables anywhere in the code without the prop drilling. It helps when there is a need for sharing state between a lot of nested components.




STRIPE 

CORE PRINCIPLE

        Frontend NEVER handles money. Backend ALWAYS Documents


react/fe -> collects card details(via stripe)

node/be -> Creates payment intent and Confirms payment

stripe -> handles the payment gateway


-> Step 1 

        Create an account in stripe

-> Publishable Key (Frontend key)

        Used to identify which stripe account the request belongs to

        initialize stripe elements ( UI )

        Collect card details securely

-> Secret Key (Backend Key)

        initialize payments
        Capture payments
        issue refunds
        etc..

Payment Flow

        1. load Stripe UI - Publishable
        2. Enter card details - Publishable
        3. initialize payment - Secret
        4. confirm payment  - both
